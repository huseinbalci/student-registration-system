Implementing a Student Registration System 
Objective: The objective of this labwork is to create a student 
registration system using Java Swing for the graphical user interface 
and file I/O for data storage. 
Tasks: 
Designing the GUI: 
• Create a JFrame for the main registration form. 
• Add labels, text fields, combo boxes, radio buttons, and a button 
for registration. 
• Design the layout using appropriate Swing layout managers like 
GridLayout or BorderLayout. 
Implementing ActionListener: 
• Implement the ActionListener interface to handle button clicks. 
• Add action listeners to the registration button. 
Validating User Input: 
• Ensure that required fields are not empty before proceeding with 
registration. 
• Validate input data formats such as email, mobile number, and 
age. 
Saving Student Data: 
• Implement file I/O to save student data into a text file. 
• Use BufferedWriter to write data into the file. 
• Serialize student objects to save and deserialize to read from 
the file (optional). 
Displaying Registration Status: 
• Create a JLabel to display registration status messages. 
• Update the label to show success or failure messages after 
registration attempts. 
Displaying Registered Students: 
• Create a new JFrame or dialog window to display the registered 
student records. 
• Read data from the text file and display it in a JTextArea or 
JTable within the new window. 
Testing: 
• Test the application by registering new students. 
• Verify that registration status messages are displayed correctly. 
• Check if registered students are displayed accurately in the 
records window.
